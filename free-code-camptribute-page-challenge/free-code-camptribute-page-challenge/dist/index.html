          <p>"When this kind of fire starts, it is very hard to put out. The tender boughs of innocence burn first, and the wind rises, and then all goodness is in jeopardy."</p>

    <blockquote id="tribute-quote" cite="https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Margaret_Lanterman">
      <p>"This is 'now,' and now will never be again.... We come from the elemental, and return to it. There is change, but nothing is lost. There is much we cannot see – air, for instance, most of the time – but knowing our next breath will follow our last without fail is an act of faith. Is it not? Dark times will always come, as night follows day. A dark age will test us all, each and every one. Trust and do not tremble in the face of the unknown. It shall not remain unknown to you for long. Robert knows this now, as will we all in the sweet by-and-by."
